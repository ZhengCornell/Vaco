Question 2: Since I have taken and am taking scores of CS, IS, DS courses among Cornell, I have channels to contact with CS, Info Science, Data Science professors to ask them for the advice about GCP, along with asking them to help me make a brief introduction before their courses begin. Besides, I will build my own projects on the GCP to help myself understand more about GCP. Thus, I could do much better propaganda during the info session, and attract students who are interesting in GCP to join my project team. We could increase our influence while programming.
